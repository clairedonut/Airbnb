# Airbnb reproduction

This project displays a reproduction of the Airbnb homepage in responsive design. This project has been updated to also include jquery plugins and dynamic elements.

## Key elements

* Mobile-first approach: Responsive web design coded first for a mobile format and then adapted to tablet and desktop breakpoints
* Media queries: Element styles are displayed and defined according to properties related to breakpoints 
* Media optimisation: optimisation of page loading time with different srcsets per image to avoid loading large images on mobile
* Jquery : a dropdown nav in mobile format, smooth scroll to page anchors, styles accroding to mouseenter, mouseleave, click etc events 
* Jquery plugins : autocomplete plugin and date picker in search form
